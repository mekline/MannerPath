%generates a random bounce-around.  If you give it a multiple of 30 frames
%(seconds) it will finish its path at the end of the movie, otherwise it
%stays at the final position for the remainder.
%All transitions from 1 edge to another take 1 sec, so there will be speed
%variation.  If you don't want that, use smoothPath afterwards.

%difference between your movie/img and the ken burns box.
%Right now it has all the corners and all the midpoints of the edges -
%movie seems to 'bounce' off the walls.
